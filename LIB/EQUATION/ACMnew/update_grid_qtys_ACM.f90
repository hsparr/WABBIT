! While the state vector and many work variables (such as the mask function for penalization)
! are explicitly time dependent, some other quantities are not. They are rather grid-dependent
! but need not to be updated in every RK or krylov substep. Hence, those quantities are updated
! after the mesh is changed (i.e. after refine_mesh) and then kept constant during the evolution
! time step.
! An example for such a quantity would be geometry factors on non-cartesian grids, but also the
! body of an insect in tethered (=fixed) flight. In the latter example, only the wings need to be
! generated at every time t. This example generalizes to any combination of stationary and moving
! obstacle, i.e. insect behind fractal tree.
! Updating those grid-depend quantities is a task for the physics modules: they should provide interfaces, if they require such qantities. In many cases, the grid_qtys are probably not used.
! Please note that in the current implementation, hvy_tmp also plays the role of a work array
